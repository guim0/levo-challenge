## Hey! this is a Challenge proposed by Levo

## It's not responsive because was asked to be a web-app, so use on a desktop

### It's a Dashboard to visualize and manage users

### This is a mocked Dashboard so there is no backend on it, was created only the frontend screens.

- Ant Desing (There where some components from Chakra UI who were broken)
